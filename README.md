### App Features
- **Modify Map (Top/Bottom Five Outlines)**
  - The app will find the largest five and smallest five values across all TIFs based on your selections. Changing the Selected Year or Variable (top-left) will modify the outlines appropriately. 
    - For example, the default map highlights the five TIFs with the largest Property Tax Extraction in 2022 as well as the five TIFs with the smallest Property Tax Extraction values in 2022.
- **TIF Selection**
  - You can select a tif by clicking within the shape boundaries on the map. This will outline the district in cyan and highlight it in yellow (similar to the top/bottom five outlines). TIF Selection causes both Data Displays to update.
- **Data Displays**
  - Data Displays are updated by TIF Selection. There are two different displays of the TIF data:
    - Top-Right UI: This panel is populated with all data points for the current TIF selection within the currently selected year.
    - Bottom-Left UI: This panel is populated with a Bar Chart that visualizes all values of the currently selected variable for the TIF that was clicked.

# TIF Resources
### What Are TIFs?
TIF stands for Tax Increment Financing. TIF Districts are designated by the municipality to capture property taxes for a fixed period of time. The captured property taxes are used to boost development in the designated TIF district. Visit the [The CivicLab](https://www.civiclab.us/) website to read more about what TIFs are and how they work. Here are two resources to start with:
- [TIF 101 Video](https://www.civiclab.us/tif-101/)
- [How Do TIFs Work?](https://www.civiclab.us/tif_illumination_project/how-do-tifs-work/)

### Where Is The Data From?
* The financial data was parsed from the City of Chicago's [TIF District Annual Report webpage](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dcd/supp_info/tif-district-annual-reports-2004-present.html). Data from 2010-2022 inclusive was parsed from the PDFs using various Python libraries.
* Shapefiles for Chicago TIF District boundaries are sourced from the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?q=tif+boundaries&sortBy=last_modified&tags=shapefiles&utf8=%E2%9C%93). The Red Line Extension (TIF# 186) is the only exception: this shape was entered in manually.
